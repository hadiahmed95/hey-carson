<p>Great news! We found the ideal expert for your project - {$this->expert->first_name} {$this->expert->last_name}</p>
<p>{$this->expert->first_name} {$this->expert->last_name} will initiate a chat with you within the project workroom shortly. Feel free to start the chat immediately.</p>
<p>They may ask for clarification or more detail about your project and goals, to make sure the best possible solutions are being recommended.</p>
<p>Expect proactive and consistent communication, fast response times to your questions, and a clear and accurate quote for your project. Should you receive a quote, you will have 5 days to accept and pay, this can be extended on request. Once the payment is made, the expert will begin the work and share regular updates with you.</p>
<p>For added peace of mind and security, your project payments are held with us in escrow until you confirm and mark the project as completed.</p>
